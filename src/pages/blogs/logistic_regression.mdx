Logistic Regression is an extremely efficient mechanism for calculating probabilities. The returned probabilities can be used in two ways:
- Applied "as is"
- Converted to binary: (True/False)

## Sigmoid Function

![Sigmoid](https://d3p2bvoe452d0z.cloudfront.net/Sigmoid.png)

The curve approaches 0 as $x$ values decrease to negative infinity, and 1 as $x$ values increase toward infinity.

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
$$

## Transforming Linear Output using Sigmoid Function

$$
z = b+w_1x_1+w_2x_2+...+w_nx_n
$$
z is the output of linear equation. a.k.a. log odds
$$
y' = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}
$$
