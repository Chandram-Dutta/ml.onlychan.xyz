Loss is the metric of how wrong a model's predictions are.

## Types of Loss

- ### L$_1$ Loss: 
	The sum of the absolute values of the difference between the predicted values and the actual values
	
	$$
	\sum |\text{actual value} - \text{predicted\ value}|
	$$

- ### MAE Loss
	Mean Absolute Error is the average of L$_1$Â losses across a set of examples
	
	$$
	\frac{1}{n}\sum|\text{actual value} - \text{predicted value}|
	$$

- ### L$_2$ Loss
	The sum of the squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values
	
	$$
	\sum(\text{actual value} - \text{predicted value})^2
	$$

- ### MSE Loss
	The average of L$_2$ losses across a set of examples
	
	$$
	\frac{1}{n}\sum(\text{actual value} - \text{predicted value})^2
	$$
## Choosing the type of loss

MSE: The model is closer to the outliers but further away from most of the other data points.

MAE:The model is further away from the outliers but closer to most of the other data points.
